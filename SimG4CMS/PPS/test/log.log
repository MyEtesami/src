----- Begin Fatal Exception 03-Aug-2015 09:49:39 CEST-----------------------
An exception of category 'DictionaryNotFound' occurred while
   [0] Constructing the EventProcessor
Exception Message:
No REFLEX data dictionary found for the following classes:

edm::Wrapper<edm::DetSetVector<RPLBarDigi> >

Most likely each dictionary was never generated,
but it may be that it was generated in the wrong package.
Please add (or move) the specification
<class name="whatever"/>
to the appropriate classes_def.xml file.
If the class is a template instance, you may need
to define a dummy variable of this type in classes.h.
Also, if this class has any transient members,
you need to specify them in classes_def.xml.
